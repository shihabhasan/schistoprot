<h4>
SchistoProt is a schistosome specific machine-learning classifier for the identification of surface and secreted proteins. 
</h4>
<h6>
The classifier uses 16 supervised machine learning techniques to discriminate between i) surface and non-surface proteins and ii) secretory and non-secretory proteins. Positive training sets have been extracted from literatures. 
As a negative training set (non-surface and non-secretory proteins), nuclear and histone related proteins were collected from the NCBI non-redundant proteins database. Hypothetical or non-biologically validated proteins have been excluded to obtain a high-quality and reliable training set. 
Recently, it has been demonstrated that such a genus specific classifier can significantly increase prediction accuracy. 
The genus specific classifier predictions are highly valuable for identifying genes important for host-parasite interaction and the discovery of novel drug and vaccine targets.
